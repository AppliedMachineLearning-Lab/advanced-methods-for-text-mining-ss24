Lectures will take place every Thursday at the B-IT (Friedrich-Hirzebruch-Allee 6, 53115 Bonn, Germany). Due to introductory events at the B-IT for newcomers, the first lecture will take place on 11.04.24 at 14:00 in Room 2.113. Exercises will take place on selected Thursdays from 12:00-13:00 in the same room (the first exercise session will occur two weeks after the first lecture). The course has 4-ETCS credits and is taught by Prof. Dr. Rafet Sifa. One week prior to each lecture, a list of recommended readings (from textbooks, reports, and research papers) related to the coursework will be announced.
